    "Random Forest trains multiple decision trees on different subsets of the data, created through bootstrap sampling (random sampling with replacement).\n",

    "\n",
    "At each split in a decision tree, Random Forest considers only a random subset of features instead of all features.\n",

    "\n",
    "For regression tasks, the final prediction is obtained by averaging the outputs of all the trees in the forest.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reduced Model Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual trees in the Random Forest are typically grown to full depth without pruning. However, because their predictions are aggregated, the ensemble as a whole generalizes well even if the individual trees are overfit."
