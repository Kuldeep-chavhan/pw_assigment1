    "Multithreading is a powerful programming technique that allows a single process to execute multiple threads concurrently. Each thread runs independently and can perform different tasks simultaneously. This is particularly useful when you want to achieve parallelism within a single program. Now, let’s break it down a bit further:\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads vs. Processes:\n",
    "A process is an instance of a program being executed. It has its own memory space, data, and execution context.\n",
    "A thread, on the other hand, is an entity within a process. It’s the smallest unit of processing that can be performed by the operating system. Threads share the same memory space as the process they belong to.\n",
    "Why Use Multithreading?\n",
    "Concurrency: Multithreading allows you to perform multiple tasks concurrently. For example, you can have one thread handling user input while another processes data in the background.\n",
    "Efficiency: Threads are lighter-weight than processes because they share memory. Creating and managing threads is faster and consumes fewer resources.\n",
    "I/O-Bound Tasks: Multithreading is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading/writing files, network communication) where waiting for external resources would otherwise block the entire program.\n",
    "Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):\n",
    "Python has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which allows only one thread to execute Python code at a time. This limitation affects CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "However, for I/O-bound tasks, multithreading can still improve performance because threads can release the GIL during I/O operations.\n",
    "The Python threading Module:\n",
    "The threading module provides a high-level interface for working with threads.\n",
    "You can create, start, join, and manage threads using this module.\n",
    "Some key functions and classes in threading:\n",
    "Thread: The class for creating threads.\n",
    "active_count(): Returns the number of currently alive threads.\n",
    "current_thread(): Returns the current thread object.\n",
    "excepthook(): Handles uncaught exceptions raised by threads.\n",
    "Other synchronization primitives like locks, semaphores, and condition variables."
