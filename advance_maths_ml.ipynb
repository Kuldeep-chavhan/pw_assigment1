    "Point Estimate\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value that serves as an estimate of a population parameter. For example, the sample mean (\n",
    "𝑥\n",
    "ˉ\n",
    ") is a point estimate of the population mean (\n",
    "𝜇\n",
    "). It's called a \"point estimate\" because it gives a specific point in the parameter space as the best guess for the unknown parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Estimate\n",
    "An interval estimate, on the other hand, provides a range of values within which the parameter is expected to lie. This is often expressed as a confidence interval, which gives an interval around the point estimate and includes the true parameter value with a certain probability. For example, a 95% confidence interval means that if we were to take many samples and build a confidence interval from each one, we would expect 95% of those intervals to contain the true population parameter."

    "Student’s t-distribution, often simply called the t-distribution, is a probability distribution used in statistics that is symmetric and bell-shaped, much like the normal distribution, but with heavier tails. This means it has a higher probability of values far from the mean. The t-distribution becomes increasingly similar to the normal distribution as the degrees of freedom (df) increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is defined by the degrees of freedom, which are related to the sample size. The fewer the degrees of freedom, the fatter the tails, indicating a greater likelihood of extreme values.\n",

    "When to Use the t-Distribution\n",
    "The t-distribution is used in hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation for small sample sizes or when the population standard deviation is unknown. Here are some common scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "Small Sample Sizes: When the sample size is small (typically less than 30), the t-distribution is more appropriate than the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unknown Population Standard Deviation: When the population standard deviation is not known, and instead, the sample standard deviation is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis Testing: For example, in a t-test to compare the means of two independent samples (two-sample t-test) or to compare the mean of a single sample to a known value (one-sample t-test).\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Intervals: When constructing confidence intervals for the mean of a population, especially with small sample sizes or unknown standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Properties\n",
    "Symmetric around the mean (zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "Flatter and wider tails compared to the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depends on the degrees of freedom (df).\n",
