    "An activation function in the context of artificial neural networks is a mathematical function applied to the output of a neuron (or node) to determine whether it should be activated, thereby passing its signal to the next layer of the network. Activation functions play a crucial role in introducing non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn and model complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "Non-linearity: Without activation functions, the network would behave like a linear model regardless of its depth, limiting its ability to solve complex problems.\n",
    "Decision-making: Activation functions help neurons decide whether to \"fire\" based on the weighted sum of inputs.\n",
    "Types:\n",
    "Linear Activation Function: Outputs the input directly (rarely used due to lack of non-linearity).\n",
    "Non-linear Activation Functions:\n",
    "Sigmoid: Outputs a value between 0 and 1, making it useful for binary classification.\n",
    "Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent): Outputs a value between -1 and 1, often used in hidden layers.\n",
    "ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): Outputs the input if it's positive, otherwise 0. Widely used for its simplicity and efficiency.\n",
    "Leaky ReLU: Allows a small, non-zero gradient for negative inputs to address the \"dying ReLU\" problem.\n",
    "Softmax: Converts a vector of values into probabilities, commonly used in the output layer for multi-class classification.\n",

    "Similar to sigmoid, tanh involves exponentials, making it computationally expensive compared to simpler activation functions like ReLU.\n",
    "When to Use tanh\n",
    "Hidden Layers:\n",
    "Historically used in the hidden layers of neural networks where zero-centered activations are beneficial.\n",
    "Tasks Requiring Symmetric Outputs:\n",
    "When outputs need to include negative values, such as when modeling deviations from a mean.\n",
    "Shallow Networks:\n",
    "More effective in shallow architectures compared to sigmoid, though often replaced by ReLU in deep networks.\n",
    "Comparison Summary\n",
    "tanh is an improvement over sigmoid due to its zero-centered nature, which helps in faster optimization.\n",
    "sigmoid is still preferred for output layers in binary classification tasks because of its probabilistic interpretation."
