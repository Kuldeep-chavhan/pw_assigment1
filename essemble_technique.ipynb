    "An ensemble technique in machine learning combines multiple models to improve the overall performance and accuracy of predictions. Instead of relying on a single model, ensemble methods leverage the strengths of multiple models, reducing errors and increasing robustness. The idea is that different models may perform well in different areas, and by combining them, the ensemble can achieve better results than any individual model alone.\n",
