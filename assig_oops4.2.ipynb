    "In other words, a class describes what an object of that class will look like, what attributes it will have, and what methods (functions) it can perform.\n",
    "It encapsulates both data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a single unit.\n",
    "Classes allow us to create user-defined data types.\n",
    "Example: If we have a class called Car, it defines the common properties (such as brand, model, color) and behaviors (such as start, stop, accelerate) that all cars share.\n",

    "An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "It is a real-world entity created based on the class blueprint.\n",
    "Objects have their own unique data (attribute values) and can perform actions (invoke methods).\n",
    "When we create an object from a class, memory is allocated for that object.\n",
    "Example: If we create an object my_car from the Car class, my_car represents a specific car with its own brand, model, and color.\n"

    "(1)Abstraction: Abstraction involves hiding the implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It allows users to interact with the functionality without needing to understand how it works internally1.\n",

    "(3)Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class (the child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (the parent class). It promotes code reuse and represents real-world relationships (such as “is-a” or “kind-of” relationships)1.\n",
    "(4)Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method name to behave differently based on the context (e.g., method overloading and method overriding)"
